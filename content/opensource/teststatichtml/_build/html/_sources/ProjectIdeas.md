# Projects

For your final group projects, try to get inspired by the datasets provided, but you are actively encouraged to work in groups and develop your own ideas. These can, but don't necessarily need to be oriented on the datasets and projects listed here:  

**Non-human animals:**

- Analysis of pigeon posture
- Analysis of mouse location and kinematics
- Synchronicity of fly locomotion

**Human animals:**

- Tracking emotional facial expressions
- Tracking hand movement and guitar chords

**Meta-projects:**

- Compare tracking performance with different amount of labels
- Compare the effect of video quality on tracking performance
