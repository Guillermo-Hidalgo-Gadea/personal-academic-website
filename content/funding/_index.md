My academic work is funded by the German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) in the context of a research assistant position in the Research Training Group “Situated Cognition” (GRK 2185/1) with the Ruhr-University Bochum.

I am also an independent science consultant and statistics coach working with university students and businesses on the side.

In an experimental attempt to monetize some of my open source contributions I have turned some of my scientific posters into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and listed them on Binance to start a [Science_NFT](https://www.binance.com/en/nft/collection/scienceghgnft-620268415220617216) collection. Go check them out if want to contribute with some cryptocurrency.
