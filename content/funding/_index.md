In an experimental attempt to monetize some of my open source contributions I have turned some of my scientific posters into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and listed them on Binance to start a [Science_NFT](https://www.binance.com/en/nft/collection/scienceghgnft-620268415220617216) collection. Go check them out if want to contribute with some cryptocurrency.
