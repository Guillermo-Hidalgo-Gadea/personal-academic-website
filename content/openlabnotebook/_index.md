## Scientific blogging in format of an open laboratory notebook 

This is a way for me to post regularly about the process of my research without having to rely on positive results to tell a story. I will try to share concise how-to guides (some more conceptual and others more technical) about what I do, directly and indirectly, during my research. In short, I will try to compile short and readable stories about actual notes in my laboratory notebook.

Sure, you can just wait a while and then check my [publications](../publication), but here you may find some interesting methods that never made it to a final publication, some insights into the behind the scenes process towards that specific publication, as well as (let's not jinx it) some negative results. Please get in touch if you are looking for details.
